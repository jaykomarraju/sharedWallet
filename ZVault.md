# ZVault - Shared Wallets DApp - Product Design Framework
Welcome to ZVault! This document outlines our vision for creating a user-friendly decentralized application (DApp) using React. ZVault aims to provide a collaborative and decentralized wallet management experience, offering a secure and collective approach towards asset management on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Interface
Our vision for the ZVault interface is to ensure a seamless user experience. The application should be clean, intuitive, and user-friendly, allowing our users to interact with the blockchain without getting overwhelmed by its complexity.

- **Header:** The application will feature a consistent header, displaying the ZVault logo and the ability for users to connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) through a clear call to action.

- **Home:** The main landing page should offer a warm welcome to users, quickly presenting them the primary actions - "Create Wallet" and "View Wallets". The user interface should be designed to be as clear and inviting as possible.

- **Create Wallet:** A simple form to capture multiple Ethereum addresses. The user interface needs to provide dynamic form fields with the ability to add or remove owner addresses for the wallet. A clean, attractive UI to display this interaction is desired.

- **Wallet Overview:** A simple yet informative dashboard, listing all wallets that the user is a part of. The presentation should be in a tabular or card format, with each item displaying the wallet address and balance at a glance, and the ability to dive in for more details.

- **Wallet Details:** When a user selects a specific wallet, they should be presented with detailed information such as the list of wallet owners, active proposals, and their voting status. An intuitive UI flow for adding new proposals and voting on existing ones should be provided.

## User Journey
The goal of our design should be to make the user journey as intuitive and straightforward as possible. From landing on our website, connecting their Ethereum wallet, creating a shared wallet, depositing funds, creating proposals, to voting and executing proposals, every step should be clear, simple, and enjoyable.

## Visual Identity
ZVault should have a professional, sleek look, with a visual identity that aligns with the ethos of the blockchain community. Careful attention should be paid to typography, color schemes, button designs, iconography, and animations. Using a UI library might be beneficial to achieve a consistent look and feel across the application.

## Mobile First
A significant number of our users will likely interact with ZVault via their mobile devices. As such, our design should adopt a "mobile-first" approach, ensuring that all features and functions work flawlessly on smaller screens.

## Interactions and Feedback
ZVault should offer clear feedback during user interactions. Whether it's form validations, transaction status updates, or error messages, the design should keep the users informed about what's happening at all times.

Our goal is to bridge the gap between the complex world of blockchain and our end users. By focusing on intuitive design, simplicity, and user experience, ZVault can truly stand out in the blockchain space.
